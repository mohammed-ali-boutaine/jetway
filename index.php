            <h1>Programming</h1>
            <p>
                Programming, also known as coding, involves writing sets of instructions that the computer can understand and execute. These instructions are written using programming languages. The programming process typically involves analyzing a problem, designing a solution, and implementing it through coding.

            <h1>Algorithm ??</h1>
            <p>
                An algorithm is a series of well-defined steps to solve a problem or accomplish a task. It is used in programming to describe the logical sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms are used to solve various problems, such as data sorting, information search, or solving mathematical problems. They can be expressed in different ways, such as flowcharts, pseudocode, or computer code. Designing an efficient algorithm involves optimizing the performance, complexity, and reliability of the solution. Algorithmic skills are essential for programmers as they enable efficient and elegant problem-solving.
